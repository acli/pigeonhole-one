===Encoder===
The encoder should now be able to output Grade 1 UEB;
however, it is not a full encoder and not all characters are supported.

On the issue of Grade 2, UEB seems to be more semantic than Unicode
and at this point I really doubt automatic translation
from Unicode text (or even Unicode HTML or even DAISY) to UEB is possible.
